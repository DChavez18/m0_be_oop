# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

1. At times I felt really, confident in my abilities and at other times when I was "unproductively struggling" I questioned my abilities. I need to make sure I utilize the resources that have been given to me and realize that I'n not in this alone.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

2. I need to emphasize the importance of taking breaks and clearing my mind, my focus doesn't wane, but I don't want to get into the habit of unproductively struggling.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

3. I learned that I can lean on my peers, and that two, three, four etc, is better than 1
